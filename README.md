wicket-atmosphere-test
======================

Test project for atmosphere wicket capabilities

2 tests :
- push the date every seconds and display on the page
- form with message push, this message is displayed in a modal window of each visitor

The second functionality is useful for customer notification (shutting down for
maintenance in 5 minutes, etc...)
